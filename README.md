## Golang Currency (Trevor Sawler) Course Outline

- Basic types in the `sync` package: mutexes (semaphores), and wait groups.
- 3 computer science programs:
  - The Producer/Consumer problem
  - The Dining Philosopher problem
  - The Sleeping Barber problem
- Real-world scenario,
  - Where we build a subset of larger (imaginary) problem where a user of a service wants to subscribe and buy one of a series of available subscriptions.
  - When they purchase a subscription, we will generate invoice, send an email, and generate PDF manual and send that to the user.
  - We will do these things concurrently.
- Writing tests for Go Concurrency
